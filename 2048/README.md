# Thanks for downloading 2048!

# Gameplay
2048 is a puzzel game where the goal is to merge together tiles all the way up 2048. Tiles with matching number
are able to merge together if they collide. This creates a new tile with the sum of those two tiles, example: tile 2 and tile 2 merges together and creates tile 4,
tile 4 and tile 4 merges together and creates tile 8, and so on...

You start the game with 2 tiles on the board and each move you make spawns a new random tile. There is a 90% chance of a tile with the value 2 to spawn and 10% chance of a tile with the value 4 to spawn.

# How to play?
Locate the file "GameMain" by opening the following folders/packages: 2048 -> src/main/java -> game. Once the file is located, open the file and press run.

You use the arrow keys to move the tiles right, left, up and down. If you want to exit the game at any point you can either press the "escape" button on your 
keyboard or just click the "x" button in the top right corner in the game window. If you for some reason want to start the game over you can simply just press "r" 
on your keyboard and a brand new board gets created. A message will appear on the screen if you win or lose the game. You win by merging tiles together
all the way until you reach the 2048 tile. Once you win a message will appear, and after that you can either restart the game or exit. You lose if the board gets filled with tiles 
and you are unable to move any of the tiles in any direction. A loss message will appear if you lose, and after tat you can either restart the game or exit.
